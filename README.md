# terragrunt-polkadot

> WIP - Do not use. Very early in development.

This is a multi-cloud reference architecture for deploying multiple different node topologies for Polkadot.

This work is very early stage and only meant to demonstrate broad architectural decisions in building out the
terragrunt scaffolding for the grant proposal [Load Balanced Endpoints](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/pull/250).
